# Zabbix accessory files
This directory contains various files which can be usable for Zabbix monitoring system. Currently here're 3 types of files:
+ `scripts` - various scripts for working with Zabbix API
+ `templates` - some my self-developed templates from real cases
+ `sql` - some useful PostgreSQL requests to Zabbix database

Details of every of them placed in sub-README in each directory
